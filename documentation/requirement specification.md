# Requirement specification

## The purpose of the software

Users can have a fun, somewhat relaxing time enjoying yet another platforming game.

### Users

The software will consist of only regular users due to the nature of the project.

### User interface

The software will consist of one main view, with a visual indicator of the current stage and level, as well as current hearts.
A simple tutorial may be shown when starting the game up.

## Functionality offered by the first iteration

- Users can move the character with their keyboard
- Users can explore a simple test level (or the first properly designed level)
- Users can see some sort of indicator of their current health

## Further development ideas

- More stages and levels (with custom graphics if time allows it)
- Secrets and easter eggs?
- Some sort of enemy character(s)
