## The purpose of the software

Using the software, users can create D&D characters through a form, delete them, save them to a file, and view them later by importing the aforementioned file.

### Users

The software will consist of only regular users who can use the software in the specified way.

### User interface

The software will consist of two views. The first view will be for character creation, and the second will be for viewing previously made characters, deleting them, and importing old ones from a file.

## Functionality offered by the first iteration

- Users can create new characters from a limited amount of options
- Users can save characters to a file
- Users can view characters created through the same session (or import them from a file)

## Further development ideas
